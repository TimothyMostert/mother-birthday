    My dearest mother, a brief message from your only son.
    <br><br>
    I love you greatly, and am so very proud to call you my mother.
    <br> 
    You care deeply, and leave those you value with no doubt in their minds that this is true.
    <br>
    There are few quite so resiliant and strong, no matter what life throws at you, the underlying current of positivity is never lost, and always appreciated.
    <br>
    From coffee to photography to digital art you are beyond talented and creative, I'm always eager to show my friends or even a stranger I've just met. Despite the instagram psychophants I'm still your number one fan :)
    <br>
    You are someone I know I could always rely on, or turn to in my times of need, no matter how great the problem you would drop everything and be there for me, I can't explain how much I value that.
    <br>
    I never feel afraid to say what I think with you, and know you would always listen and try to understand everything.
    <br>
    I can see your growth; in mindset, health and values. Even when I'm a relentless pest you listen openly and reflect honestly, not just taking what I say but filtering through your own authentic worldview.
    <br>
    You are courageous, genuine and totally eccentric and for all these things you are always you.
    <br>
    Lots and lots and lots of Love
    <br>
    Kuku
